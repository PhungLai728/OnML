on my lender pulled my report and ocwen was reporting a past mortgage almost correctly under my bankruptcy but still reporting a balance . i just had my lender pull a new report on and now they are completely violating the fcra laws and completely ruining my ability to move forward with any financing . it now shows   NUMBER day lates the notes changed from ch bk to foreclosure proceedings started  show a balance and a large past due amount . they need to report this correctly asap and confirm it is done in writing . i have included an attachment showing their malicious intent .
