my loan was serviced through green tree servicing . and while in chapter bankruptcy i recieved numerous calls when i fell behind with my mortgage . always made the payment but however when i tried to explain to the servicer that as money was tight and the pay days fell different that i need more time . i recieved phone calls till late up into the night . even so to tell me that i was already in bankruptcy i might as well go ahead and give the property back or they were gon na forclose on me . as the continued daily the stress of the horrible phone calls influnced me to give the property back to them and add it to my bankruptcy . as i am hurt that i had toogive my home up i was pressured to do so
