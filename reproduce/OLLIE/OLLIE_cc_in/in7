i have this payment on automatic pay . i never miss a payment . the bank generally changes my mortgage payment due to shortages or overages on the impound account . this is okay . however i never get their notices . they increased my payment dollars and because that overage was not paid they charged me a dollar late fee even though i made the dollar payment on time . there should be a law that banks can not charge more on a late fee than what is owed .
