my original monthly mtg payment was per month at closing in i then received a check on in the amount of for an escrow shortage . then received a tax bill from the county assessors showing tax assessment in amount of per year and according to my closing disclosure they were escrowing per month and only collected  NUMBER mths  i am now being told my payment is increasing by per month and they also requested that i return the escrow shortage check i received in  . i have a made multiple calls for an explanation that is logical and reasonably understood and have not been successful in receiving a resolution . i believe this is a servicing error that should be resolved by the lender . i have consistently met my financial obligations on a monthly basis and should not be held liable for their inability to manage escrow accounts .
