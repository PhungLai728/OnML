received letter dated stating that my NUMBER yr heloc loan i will have to be paid off on or before and will not be renewed in  . i was lead to believe at time of signing that they could renew loan after initial NUMBER yrs . this was also reiterated by  senior vp new york community bank a couple of yrs ago . i emailed and called her when i received inclosed letter and she said i should start looking for another solution now . never offered any other loan or help from nycb . they bought out and closed down my bank branch in but serviced the loans . please see section of agreement i signed in  . i believe servicing the loan also means according to agreement .
